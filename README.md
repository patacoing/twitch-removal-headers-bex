This repository is a browser extension which aims to remove redundant layouts on twitch's chat.

## Why this BEX ?

I've only got one monitor, and when I'm watching a livestream, I like to do other things at the same time.
Because I only have one monitor, I have to reduce the size of the stream page and place it in the bottom right-hand corner.
I like to watch the stream's chat too, so I shrink the window to the limit where I can still see the chat.
But at that size, the chat's header and the gift banner take up a lot of space (almost 50% of the height). So, every time,
I go to the elements inspector to delete those annoying layouts. I got tired of doing this, so I built this tiny BEX to do
the work automatically every time I go on a Twitch stream.
